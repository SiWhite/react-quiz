## React.js Quiz App ##

A fairly simple quiz app I created from scratch as a means of trying to learn to use React.js.

It uses the [https://opentdb.com/]Open Trivia Database API to pull 10 random multi-choice trivia questions the user can answer, and then shows the user's score out of 10, along with the correct answers for each of the questions.

A working demo can be found [https://silentdesigns.co.nz/react-quiz/]here.
