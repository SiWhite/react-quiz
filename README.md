## React.js Quiz App ##

A fairly simple quiz app I created from scratch as a means of trying to learn to use React.js.

Created using create-react-app [https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app], it uses the Open Trivia Database API [https://opentdb.com/] to pull 10 random multi-choice trivia questions the user can answer, and then shows the user's score out of 10, along with the correct answers for each of the questions.

A working demo can be found at https://silentdesigns.co.nz/react-quiz/.

TODO: Allow custom questions via a custom .JSON file.
